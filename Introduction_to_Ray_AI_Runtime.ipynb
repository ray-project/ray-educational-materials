    "You've now just created a Ray Dataset, preprocessed some features, built a model with XGBoost, searched a hyperparameter space for the best configuration, loaded the best model from a checkpoint to perform batch inference, and served that model for online inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this end-to-end example, you explored how to use Ray AIR to distribute an entire ML pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Datasets`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The standard way to load and exchange data in Ray AIR. In AIR, Datasets are used extensively for data loading and transformation. They are meant as a last-mile bridge from ETL pipeline outputs to distributed applications and libraries in Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Preprocessors`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Preprocessors are primitives that transform input data into features. They operate on Datasets, making them scalable and compatible with a variety of datasources and dataframe libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Checkpoints`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Store the full state of the model periodically, so that partially trained models are available and can be used to resume training from an intermediate point, instead of starting from scratch; also allows for the best model to be saved for batch inference later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Trainers`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Trainers are wrapper classes around third-party training frameworks such as XGBoost, Pytorch, and Tensorflow. They are built to help integrate with Ray Actors (for distribution), Ray Datasets, and Ray Tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Tuner`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Provides an interface that works with AIR Trainers to perform distributed hyperparameter tuning. You define a set of hyperparameters you wish to tune in a search space, specify a search algorithm, and the Tuner returns its results in a ResultGrid that contains metrics, results, and checkpoints for each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`BatchPredictor`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Loads the best model from a checkpoint to perform batch inference on large-scales or online inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Deployments`**\n",

    "    A managed group of Ray actors that can be addressed together and will handle requests load-balanced across them.\n",
