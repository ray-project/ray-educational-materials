    "## Ray cluster perspective: actors\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ray, user code is executed by worker processes. These workers can run tasks (stateless functions) or actors (stateful class instances).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Serve is built on actors, allowing deployments to collect expensive state once (such as loading a ML model) and to reuse it across many service requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you may never need to code any Ray tasks or actors yourself, your Ray Serve application has full access to those cluster capabilities and you may wish to use them to implement other functionality (e.g., service or operations that don't need to accept HTTP traffic). More information is at https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Serve design\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, a few other actors are used to make up a serve instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Controller: A global actor unique to each Serve instance is responsible for managing other actors. Serve API calls like creating or getting a deployment make remote calls to the Controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTTP Proxy: By default there is one HTTP proxy actor on the head node that accepts incoming requests, forwards them to replicas, and responds once they are completed. For scalability and high availability, you can also run a proxy on each node in the cluster via the location field of http_options.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deployment Replicas: Actors that execute the code in response to a request. Each replica processes requests from the HTTP proxy.\n",
    "<img src='https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/_images/architecture-2.0.svg' width=700 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Incoming requests, once resolved to a particular deployment, are queued. The requests from the queue are assigned round-robin to available replicas as long as capacity is available. This design provides load balancing and elasticity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Capacity can be managed with the `max_concurrent_queries` parameter to the deployment decorator. This value defaults to 100 and represents the maximum number of queries that will be sent to a replica of this deployment without receiving a response. Each replica has its own queue to collect and smooth incoming request traffic."

    "By default -- if nothing specified, as in our examples above -- the default is a single. We can specify a larger, constant number of replicas in the decorator:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@serve.deployment(num_replicas=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For autoscaling, instead of `num_replicas`, we provide an `autoscaling_config` dictionary. With autoscaling, we can specify a minimum and maximum range for the number of replicas, the initial replica count, a load target, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is example of extended configuration -- see https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/scaling-and-resource-allocation.html#scaling-and-resource-allocation for more details:\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",

    "`min_replicas` can also be set to zero to create a \"serverless\" style design: in exchange for potentially slower startup, no actors (or their CPU/GPU resources) need to be permanently reserved.\n",

    "### Autoscaling LLM chat\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM-based chat service is a good example for seeing autoscaling in action, because LLM inference is relative expensive so we can easily build up a queue of requests to the service. The autoscaler responds to the dynamics of queue sizes and will launch additional replicas."
