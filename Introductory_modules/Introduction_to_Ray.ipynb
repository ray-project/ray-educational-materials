    "Welcome, we're glad to have you along! This module serves as an interactive introduction to Ray, a flexible distributed computing framework built for Python with data science and machine learning practitioners in mind. Before we jump into the structure of this tutorial, let us first unpack the context of where we are coming from, along with the motivation for learning Ray.\n",

    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about our daily interactions with artificial intelligence (AI), products such as recommendation systems, photo editing software, and auto-captioning on videos come to mind. In addition to these user-facing experiences, enterprise-level use cases like reducing downtime in manufacturing, order-fulfillment optimization, and maximizing power generation in wind farms contribute to the ever-growing integration of AI with the way we live. Today's AI applications require enormous amounts of data to be trained on and machine learning models tend to grow over time. They have become so complex and infrastructure intensive that developers have no option but to distribute execution across multiple machines. However, distributed computing is hard. It requires specialized knowledge about orchestrating clusters of computers together to efficiently schedule tasks and must provide features like fault tolerance when a component fails, high availability to minimize service interruption, and autoscaling to reduce waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, machine learning pracitioner, developer, or engineer, your contribution may center on building data processing pipelines, training complicated models, running efficient hyperparameter experiments, creating simulations of agents, and/or serving your application to users. In each case, you need to choose a distributed system to support each task, but you don't want to learn a different programming language or toss out your existing toolbox. This is where Ray comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Ray?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray is an open source, distributed execution framework that allows you to scale AI and machine learning workloads. Our goal is to keep things simple (which is enabled by a concise core API) so that you can parallelize Python programs on your laptop, cluster, cloud, or even on-premise with minimal code changes. Ray automatically handles all aspects of distributed execution including orchestration, scheduling, fault tolerance, and auto scaling so that you can scale your apps without becoming a distributed systems expert. With a rich ecosystem of libraries and integrations with many important data science tools, Ray lowers the effort needed to scale compute intensive workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Outline**\n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook is part of a series where we will discuss the four major **layers** that comprise Ray, namely its core engine, high-level libraries, ecosystem of integrations, and cluster deployment support (see Figure 1). To foster active learning, you will encounter short coding excercises and discussion questions throughout the notebook to reinforce knowledge through practice. In this first notebook, we will cover:\n",

    "Ray Core is a low-level, distributed computing framework for Python with a concise core API, and you can think of it as the foundation that Ray's data science libraries (Ray AIR) and third-party integrations (Ray Ecosystem) are built on. This simple and general-purpose Python library enables every developer to easily build scalable, distributed systems that run on your laptop, cluster, cloud or Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength lies in Ray Core's simple primitives: Tasks, Actors, and Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:** Ray enables you to designate functions to be executed asychronously on separate Python workers. These asynchronous Ray functions, *tasks*, can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources which are used by the cluster scheduler to distribute tasks for parallelized execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actors:** What tasks are to functions, actors are to classes. An actor is a stateful worker and methods of the actor are scheduled on that specific worker and can access and mutate the state of that worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects:** In Ray, tasks and actors create and compute on objects, and we refer to these objects as *remote objects* because they can be stored anywhere in a Ray cluster. We use *object references* to refer to them, and they are cached in Ray's distributed shared memory *object store*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray sets up and manages clusters of computers so that you can run distributed tasks on them. For now, the best way to understand Ray Core is to motivate it with some popular use cases and then try our hand at parallelizing a program outselves.\n",

    "***\n",
    "Let's take a look at how we can apply Ray Core's flexible and simple API to scale a bare bones version of a common ML task: cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have a dataset of [California Housing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html) with 20,640 samples and features including `[longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, median_house_value, ocean_proximity]`. Given that we want to use a linear regression model, we want to assess how the results will generalize to an unseen independent dataset, say, on new housing data coming in this year. To do this, we would try cross-validation which is a model validation technique that resamples different portions of the data to train and test a model on different iterations. After we conduct these trials, we can average the error to get an estimate of the model's predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, training the same model multiple times on different subsets of a dataset can take a long time, especially if you're working with a much more complex model and larger dataset. Pictured below in Figure 3, the sequential approach trains each model one after another in a series.\n",

    "We just trained 100 linear regression models in a series and averaged their R-squared values in about ~1 second. Let's now leverage Ray to train these models in parallel (where multiple tasks may happen simultaneously) and see a runtime improvement. In Figure 4, you can visually inspect the difference where the scheduler assigns each available worker (in this timeline, we chose `n = 4` workers) a task. The scheduler itself has a nontrivial overhead involved with communicating between workers and other cluster management.\n",

    "Notice in Figure 5 that we need to use four API calls:\n",

    "1. `ray.init()` - initialize a Ray context\n",
    "2. `@ray.remote` - a decorator that turns functions into tasks and classes into actors\n",

    "4. `ray.get()` - returns an object or list of objects from the object ID\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that instead of storing the result of `train.remote()` directly into a list of `errors`, we instead store it in a list called `obj_ids`. Once you run a Ray remote function, it will immediately return an `ObjectID` (or 'Object Reference'). This `ObjectID` is a *promise* of future work, meaning that the task is delegated to a worker, an `ObjectID` is returned while the task executes in the background, and in order to access the expected output, you need to call `ray.get()` on the `ObjectID`\n",

    "Quick sort is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm, a strategy of solving a large problem by recursively breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems. By nature, this strategy lends itself well to a parallel implementation because the execution of each operation independently solves smaller instances of the same problem which is then merged into the final solution.\n",
