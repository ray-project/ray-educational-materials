    "  <strong><a href=\"https://www.ray.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray</a></strong> is an open-source unified compute framework that makes it easy to scale AI and Python workloads.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray provides the compute layer to scale applications without becoming a distributed systems expert. These are some key processes that Ray automatically handles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Orchestration.** Managing the various components of a distributed system.\n",
    "* **Scheduling.** Coordinating when and where tasks are executed.\n",
    "* **Fault tolerance.** Ensuring tasks complete regardless of inevitable points of failure.\n",
    "* **Auto-scaling.** Adjusting the number of resources allocated to dynamic demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To lower the effort needed to scale compute intensive workloads, Ray takes a Python-first approach and integrates with many common data science tools. This allows ML practitioners to parallelize Python applications from a laptop to a cluster with minimal code changes.\n",

    "#### Distributed computing: a bit of context and project history\n",

    "Distributed computing is becoming increasingly relevant for modern machine learning systems. OpenAI's recent paper [AI and Compute](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/) suggests that the amount of compute needed to train AI models has roughly doubled every 3.5 months since 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, distributed systems are hard to program. Scaling a Python application to a cluster introduces challenges in communication, scheduling, security, failure handling, heterogeneity, transparency, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This context drove the development of Ray: a solution to enable developers to run Python code on clusters without having to think about how to orchestrate and utilize individual machines. The same researchers who created Ray at the University of California Berkeley's [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) (the successor to the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/about/) that created [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/)) founded [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/)——a managed Ray platform that offers hosted solutions for Ray applications."

    "Some examples of successful user stories include the following:\n",
    "* [Instacart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t26ucTy0Rs) uses Ray to power their large scale fulfillment ML pipline.\n",

For example, a developer can specify in the same application that a one task needs 128 CPUs, another task only requires 0.5 GPUs, and an actor requires 36 CPUs and 8 GPUs.\n",
