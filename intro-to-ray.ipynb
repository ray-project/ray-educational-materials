    "(*Suggested Time To Complete: ** minutes*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, we're glad to have you along! This module serves as an interactive introduction to Ray, a flexible distributed computing framework built for Python with data science and machine learning practitioners in mind. Before we jump into the structure of this tutorial, let us first unpack the context of where we are coming from along with the motivation for learning Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about our daily interactions with artificial intelligence (AI), products such as recommendation systems, photo editing software, and auto-captioning on videos come to mind. In addition to these, user-facing experiences, enterprise-level use cases like reducing downtime in manufacturing, order-fulfillment optimization, and maximizing power generation in wind farms contribute to ever-growing integration of AI with the way we live. Furthermore, today's AI applications require enormous amounts of data to be trained on and machine learning models tend to grow over time. They have become so complex and infrastructure intensive that developers have no option but to distribute execution across multiple machines. However, distributing computing is hard. It requires specialized knowledge about orchestrating clusters of computers together to efficiently schedule tasks and must provide features like fault tolerance when a component fails, high availability to minimize service interruption, and autoscaling to reduce waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, machine learning pracitioner, developer, or engineer, your contribution may center on building data processing pipelines, training complicated models, running efficient hyperparameter experiments, creating simulations of agents, and/or serving your application to users. In each case, you need to choose a distributed system to support each task, but you don't want to learn a different programming language or toss out your existing toolbox. This is where Ray comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Ray?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray is an open source, distributed execution framework that allows you to scale AI and machine learning workloads. Our goal is to keep things simple (which is enabled by a concise core API) so that you can parallelize Python programs on your laptop, cluster, cloud, or even on-premise with minimal code changes. Ray automatically handles all aspects of distributed execution including orchestration, scheduling, fault tolerance, and auto scaling so that you can scale your apps without becoming a distributed systems expert. With a rich ecosystem of distributed machine learning libraries and integrations with many important data science tools, Ray lowers the effort needed to scale compute intensive workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Outline**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the four major **layers** that comprise Ray, namely its core engine, high-level libraries, ecosystem of integrations, and cluster deployment support (*see Figure #TBD*). In each notebook section, we will cover a layer of Ray through a basic example, and to foster active learning, you will encounter short coding excercises and discussion questions throughout the notebook to reinforce knowledge through practice. This tutorial is designed to be both narrative as well as modular, so feel free to work through in order or skip to the relevant material for you. Below, you'll find a table of contents.\n",

This simple and general-purpose Python library enables every developer to easily build scalable, distributed systems that run on your laptop, cluster, cloud or Kubernetes.\n",

    "In this example, we will refresh ourselves on the classic implementation of the quick sort algorithm, implement a distributed version using Ray Core, and compare the differences between the two at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a glance, quick sort selects an element from the array as a pivot, partitions the array into two sub-arrays (according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot), then sorts them recursively. You can preview an animation of quick sort in action below in Figure **#TBD.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick sort is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm, a strategy of solving a large problem by recursively breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems. By nature, this strategy lends itself well to a parallel implementation because the execution of each operation independently solves smaller instances of the same problem which is then merged into the final solution.\n",

    "# Part Three: Ray Ecosystem\n",
    "---\n",
    "Up until now, we've covered Ray Core, the low-level, distributed computing framework, as well as Ray AIR, the set of high-level native libraries which include Ray Data, Train, Tune, Serve, and RLlib. In addition, Ray integrates with a growing ecosystem of the most popular Python and machine learning libraries and frameworks that you may already be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to create new standards, Ray allows you to scale existing workloads by unifying tools in a common interface. This interface enables you to run tasks in a distributed way, a property most of the respective backends don't have, or not to the same extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Ray Datasets is backed by Arrow and comes with many integrations to other frameworks, such as Spark and Dask. Ray Train and RLlib are backed by the full power of Tensorflow and PyTorch. Ray Tune supports algorithms from practically every noteable HPO tool available, including Hyperopt, Optuna, Nevergrad, Ax, SigOpt, and many others. Ray Serve can be used with frameworks such as FastAPI, gradio, and Streamlit. With ample opportunity to extend current projects as well as integrate more backends in the future, a key strength of Ray is this robust design pattern for integration which you can read more about [here](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/ray-distributed-library-patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete list of integrations with links, go to the [Ray Ecosystem](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/ray-libraries.html#) page in the docs."

    "🎉 Congratulations! You have completed your first tutorial on an Introduction to Ray! We discussed the three layers of Ray: Core, AIR, and the Ecosystem. Each library in Ray AIR (Data, Train, Tune, Serve, RLLib) and the ecosystem of integrated libraries runs on Ray Core's distributed execution engine, and with Ray Clusters, you can deploy your workloads on AWS, GCP, Azure, or on Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can learn and get more involved with our active community of developers and researchers by checking out the following resources:\n",
    "- 📖 [Ray's \"Getting Started\" Guides](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/index.html): A collection of QuickStart Guides for every library including installation walkthrough, examples, blogs, talks, and more!\n",
    "- 💻 [Official Ray Website](https://www.ray.io/): Browse the ecosystem and use this site as a hub to get the information that you need to get going and building with Ray.\n",
    "- 💬 [Join the Community on Slack](https://forms.gle/9TSdDYUgxYs8SA9e8): Find friends to discuss your new learnings in our Slack space.\n",
    "- 📣 [Use the Discussion Board](https://discuss.ray.io/): Ask questions, follow topics, and view announcements on this community forum.\n",
    "- 🙋‍♀️ [Join a Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Ray-Meetup/): Tune in on meet-ups to listen to compelling talks, get to know other users, and meet the team behind Ray.\n",
    "- 🪲 [Open an Issue](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/new/choose): Ray is constantly evolving to improve developer experience. Submit feature requests, bug-reports, and get help via GitHub issues."
