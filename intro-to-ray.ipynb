    "\n",
    "Welcome, we're glad to have you along! This module serves as an interactive introduction to Ray, a flexible distributed computing framework built for Python with data science and machine learning practitioners in mind. Before we jump into the structure of this tutorial, let us first unpack the context of where we are coming from along with the motivation for learning Ray.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about our daily interactions with artificial intelligence (AI), products such as recommendation systems, photo editing software, and auto-captioning on videos come to mind. In addition to these, user-facing experiences, enterprise-level use cases like reducing downtime in manufacturing, order-fulfillment optimization, and maximizing power generation in wind farms contribute to ever-growing integration of AI with the way we live. Furthermore, today's AI applications require enormous amounts of data to be trained on and machine learning models tend to grow over time. They have become so complex and infrastructure intensive that developers have no option but to distribute execution across multiple machines. However, distributing computing is hard. It requires specialized knowledge about orchestrating clusters of computers together to efficiently schedule tasks and must provide features like fault tolerance when a component fails, high availability to minimize service interruption, and autoscaling to reduce waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, machine learning pracitioner, developer, or engineer, your contribution may center on building data processing pipelines, training complicated models, running efficient hyperparameter experiments, creating simulations of agents, and/or serving your application to users. In each case, you need to choose a distributed system to support each task, but you don't want to learn a different programming language or toss out your existing toolbox. This is where Ray comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Ray?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray is an open source, distributed execution framework that allows you to scale AI and machine learning workloads. Our goal is to keep things simple (which is enabled by a concise core API) so that you can parallelize Python programs on your laptop, cluster, cloud, or even on-premise with minimal code changes. Ray automatically handles all aspects of distributed execution including orchestration, scheduling, fault tolerance, and auto scaling so that you can scale your apps without becoming a distributed systems expert. With a rich ecosystem of distributed machine learning libraries and integrations with many important data science tools, Ray lowers the effort needed to scale compute intensive workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Outline**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the four major **layers** that comprise Ray, namely its core engine, high-level libraries, ecosystem of integrations, and cluster deployment support (see Figure 1). In each notebook section, we will cover a layer of Ray through a basic example, and to foster active learning, you will encounter short coding excercises and discussion questions throughout the notebook to reinforce knowledge through practice. This tutorial is designed to be both narrative as well as modular, so feel free to work through in order or skip to the relevant material for you. Below, you'll find a table of contents.\n",

    "Ray Core is a low-level, distributed computing framework for Python with a concise core API, and you can think of it as the foundation that Ray's data science libraries (Ray AIR) and third-party integrations (Ray Ecosystem) are built on. This simple and general-purpose Python library enables every developer to easily build scalable, distributed systems that run on your laptop, cluster, cloud or Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength lies in Ray Core's simple primitives: Tasks, Actors, and Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:** Ray enables you to designate functions to be executed asychronously on separate Python workers. These asynchronous Ray functions, *tasks*, can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources which are used by the cluster scheduler to distribute tasks for parallelized execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actors:** What tasks are to functions, actors are to classes. An actor is a stateful worker and methods of the actor are scheduled on that specific worker and can access and mutate the state of that worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects:** In Ray, tasks and actors create and compute on objects, and we refer to these objects as *remote objects* because they can be stored anywhere in a Ray cluster. We use *object references* to refer to them, and they are cached in Ray's distributed shared memory *object store*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray sets up and manages clusters of computers so that you can run distributed tasks on them. For more information about how Ray clusters work in detail, jump down to Part Four of this notebook or [check out the documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html#cluster-head-node). For now, the best way to understand Ray Core is to motivate it with some popular use cases and then try our hand at parallelizing a program outselves.\n",

    "At a glance, quick sort selects an element from the array as a pivot, partitions the array into two sub-arrays (according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot), then sorts them recursively. You can preview an animation of quick sort in action below in Figure 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick sort is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm, a strategy of solving a large problem by recursively breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems. By nature, this strategy lends itself well to a parallel implementation because the execution of each operation independently solves smaller instances of the same problem which is then merged into the final solution.\n",

    "# Part Three: Ray Ecosystem\n",
    "---\n",
    "Up until now, we've covered Ray Core, the low-level, distributed computing framework, as well as Ray AIR, the set of high-level native libraries which include Ray Data, Train, Tune, Serve, and RLlib. In addition, Ray integrates with a growing ecosystem of the most popular Python and machine learning libraries and frameworks that you may already be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to create new standards, Ray allows you to scale existing workloads by unifying tools in a common interface. This interface enables you to run tasks in a distributed way, a property most of the respective backends don't have, or not to the same extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Ray Datasets is backed by Arrow and comes with many integrations to other frameworks, such as Spark and Dask. Ray Train and RLlib are backed by the full power of Tensorflow and PyTorch. Ray Tune supports algorithms from practically every noteable HPO tool available, including Hyperopt, Optuna, Nevergrad, Ax, SigOpt, and many others. Ray Serve can be used with frameworks such as FastAPI, gradio, and Streamlit. With ample opportunity to extend current projects as well as integrate more backends in the future, a key strength of Ray is this robust design pattern for integration which you can read more about [here](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/ray-distributed-library-patterns).\n",

    "A Ray cluster consists of nodes that are connected to each other via a network. You can program against the so-called driver, the program root, which lives on the head node. The driver can run jobs, that is a collection of tasks, that are run on the nodes in the cluster. Specifically, the individual tasks of a job are run on worker processes on worker nodes.\n",

The number of worker nodes may be autoscaled with application demand as specified by your Ray cluster configuration. The head node runs the autoscaler. Users can submit jobs for execution on the Ray cluster, or can interactively use the cluster by connecting to the head node and running `ray.init`.\n",

    "Every Ray cluster has one node which is designated as the head node of the cluster. The head node is identical to other worker nodes, except that it also runs singleton processes responsible for cluster management such as the autoscaler and the Ray driver processes which run Ray jobs. Ray may schedule tasks and actor on the head node just like any other worker node, unless configured otherwise.\n",

    "Worker Node\n",
