    "Ray enables arbitrary Python functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers. These asynchronous Ray functions are called “tasks.” You can specify task's resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources. These resource requests are used by the cluster scheduler to distribute tasks across the cluster for parallelized execution.  \n",
