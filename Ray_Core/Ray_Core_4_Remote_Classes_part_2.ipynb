These patterns allows you to write distributed applications. In this tutorial we'll explore one of the design pattern, commonly used in Ray libraries to scale workloads.\n",

    "### Tree of Actors Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is primarily used in Ray libraries [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html), [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html), and [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html) to train models in a parallel or conduct distributed HPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a tree of actors pattern, a collection of workers as Ray actors (or in some cases Ray tasks too), are managed by a supervisor actor. For example, you want to train multiple models, each of a different ML algorithm, at the same time, while being able to inspect its state during its training. As methology to examine simple baseline models rapidly, this pattern helps machine learning engineers to quickly build a set of baseline models for comparison.\n",
