This is key to achieving massive parallelism, for it allows a devloper to launch many remote tasks, each returning a remote future object ID.

    "When passing a large argument (>100KB) by value to a task, Ray will implicitly store the argument in the object store and the worker process will fetch the argument to the local object store from the caller’s object store before running the task. If we pass the same large argument to multiple tasks, Ray will end up storing multiple copies of the argument in the object store since Ray doesn’t do deduplication.\n",
