    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Actors extend the [Ray API](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/package-ref.html) from functions (tasks) to classes. An actor is essentially a stateful worker (or a service). When a new actor is instantiated, a new worker is created or an exsisting worker is used. The methods of the actor are scheduled on that specific worker and can access and mutate the state of that worker. Like tasks, actors support CPU, GPU, and custom resource requirements.\n",

    "Ray Actor pattern is powerful. They allow you to take a Python class and instantiate it as a stateful microservice that can be queried from other actors and tasks and even other Python applications. Actors can be passed as arguments to other tasks and actors. \n",

    "When you instantiate a remote Actor, a separate worker process is attached to a worker process and becomes an Actor process on that worker node—all for the purpose of running methods called on the actor.
