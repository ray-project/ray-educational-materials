    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully gained experience in using Ray Train to fine-tune a vision transformer model for semantic segmentation.In the upcoming module, you will be able to build on this example by conducting a series of hyperparameter tuning experiments using Ray Tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Distributed model training\n",
    "    -   Training and fine-tuning large neural networks requires a massive amount of compute, so the only solution is to distribute this workload.\n",
    "    -   Data parallelism offers a pattern for sharding a large dataset across multiple machines for training and gradient synchronization.\n",
    "    -   This orchestration and maintenance is challenging, and Ray AIR offers a unified compute solution to scale this workload that integrates well with other stages in the pipeline.\n",
    "-   Fine-tuning Segformer on MITADE20K\n",
    "    -   Data ingest\n",
    "        -   Ray Data can be used to ingest and preprocess training images. These same transformations can be applied during tuning, inference, and serving.\n",
    "    -   Distributed training\n",
    "        -   Ray Train can fine-tune a transformer model, in this case implementing the data parallel design pattern by running PyTorch's [Distributed Data Parallel](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) as the backend.\n",
    "    -   Evaluation\n",
    "        -   You used Ray AIR's BatchPredictor to assess performance of the fine-tuned model by running inference.\n"
