    "## About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this module right for you?\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is an extension of [Scaling Batch Inference](https://github.com/ray-project/ray-educational-materials/blob/main/Computer_vision_workloads/Semantic_segmentation/Scaling_batch_inference.ipynb) and presents another approach for distributed batch inference on Ray. Through this short exploration of Ray Datasets' `map_batches` functionality, you will approach the same semantic segmentation task as before and use only Datasets to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be interesting and relevant to those who wish to either explore different use cases for Ray Data or augment their understanding of scalable batch inference on Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",

    "  * [Ray Core](https://github.com/ray-project/ray-educational-materials/tree/main/Ray_Core)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, it is highly recommended to complete the [Scaling Batch Inference](https://github.com/ray-project/ray-educational-materials/blob/main/Computer_vision_workloads/Semantic_segmentation/Scaling_batch_inference.ipynb) module prior to working through this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement batch inference on a semantic segmentation task with Ray Datasets by using `map_batches`.\n",
    "* Customize the compute resources for inference by experimenting with the `ActorPoolStrategy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up environment from \"Scaling Batch Inference\" module.\n",
    "* Distributed batch inference with Ray Datasets.\n",
    "  * Create a Ray Dataset.\n",
    "  * Create a prediction class with inference logic.\n",
    "  * (Optional) Specify compute by defining an actor pool strategy.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Ray Datasets](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/dataset.html) are the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray libraries and applications. They are designed to provide distributed loading, preprocessing, and transformations such as [maps](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/dataset.html#ray.data.Dataset.map_batches), [global and grouped aggregations](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/grouped_dataset.html#ray.data.grouped_dataset.GroupedDataset), and [shuffling operations](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/dataset.html#ray.data.Dataset.random_shuffle). In this bonus notebook, you will be leveraging Ray Datasets' [`map_batches`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/dataset.html#ray.data.Dataset.map_batches) method as a means to perform batch inference. \n",

In the third approach, you used `BatchPredictor`, which took in a Checkpoint (saved trained model) and a Predictor (class that defined inference logic) to generate predictions on a Ray Dataset.\n",
