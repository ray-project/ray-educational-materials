    "Part of the Ray Core primitives, [Ray Tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html#ray-remote-functions) offer an easy way to distribute inference across a compute cluster. Tasks are Python functions that execute remotely in the cluster, allowing multiple processes to work on different tasks concurrently (see: [Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, tasks contain replicas of the trained model to compute predictions on input data. Since tasks do not store or modify any internal state, we say they are *stateless*. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a stateless function in deep learning is the [SGD optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) because it only updates weights (the output) based on the gradient of the loss function (the input, along with the current weights).

    "\n",
    "In the previous approach, the trained model is loaded and discarded after each batch. This works great for smaller models, however, loading large, complex models into memory can be computationally expensive. In addition, you may want the ability to capture some persistent internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ray Actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html) are *stateful objects*, meaning they maintain an internal state. Other examples of stateful objects include Python classes and the [Adam optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) commonly used in deep learning. Due to this property, actors can run inference on multiple batches and avoid the overhead of reloading the model after each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up stateful inference involves a few important steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create replicas of the trained model as Ray Actors.\n",
    "2. Feed data into these model replicas in parallel and retrieve predictions.\n",
    "3. Continue to manage idle actors and assign tasks until the entire inference job completes.\n",

    "When using Ray Actors for stateful inference, it is important to implement *load balancing*, or appropriate distribution of work among workers to utilize resources efficiently. This process involves keeping track of in-flight tasks to assign new batches to available actors continuously until the entire process completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using actors directly offers more control over how tasks are assigned. However, you may opt to use the convenient [Ray ActorPool](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/package-ref.html#ray-util-actorpool) utility which handles load balancing (futures management) automatically. This abstraction wraps a list of actors and distributes the workload, allowing you to focus on the inference logic.\n",

    "## Summary: Choosing a Ray architecture for batch inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you have encountered two approaches for scalable, distributed batch inference with Ray:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Batch inference with Ray AI Runtime (AIR)\n",
    "1. Batch inference with Ray Core API\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare these architectures and choose the appropriate one for your specific needs, consider two main categories: Ray Core-based approaches and Ray AI Runtime (AIR)-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ray Core-based approaches\n",
    "These approaches involve using Ray Core primitives, such as Tasks, Actors, and the optional [ActorPool utility](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/package-ref.html#ray-util-actorpool). Each method shares the ability to offer fine-grained control over the behavior of a distributed application. Ray Core-based batch inference exposes the parallelism mechanisms and allows you to specify *how* inference should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some, this high level of control fits their use case well. One of Anyscale's customers performs large-scale batch inference on satellite images. Because each image is so large, it makes sense for them to run prediction on single images. Using Ray to parallelize inference allows them to control compute resources assigned to individual tasks, and this straightforward application significantly cuts down on runtime over alternative methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar vein, [Dendra](https://dendra.io/) utilizes model replicas on Ray Actors to run batch inference on aerial imagery for [ecological restoration](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/how-ray-and-anyscale-make-it-easy-to-do-massive-scale-machine-learning-on). Ray allows their inference pipeline to scale from thousands to millions of ecosystem images without having to change any underlying infrastructure. Richard Decal, the Lead ML Engineer at Dendra, explains \"This approach allowed us to maximize our network I/O and GPUs usage across the cluster.\" Now, Dendra can focus on its core business while offloading the compute management to Ray and Anyscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ray AI Runtime (AIR)-based approaches\n",
    "These approaches involve using Ray AIR's functionality through [BatchPredictor](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/package-ref.html#batch-predictor) performing inference on [Ray Datasets](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/dataset.html). By using these high-level abstractions, you define *what* needs to be done rather than *how* it should be done. You can focus on the inference logic for your specific use case while delegating the responsibility of distributing execution to Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray AIR may be a convenient choice for a variety of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [BatchPredictor](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/package-ref.html#batch-predictor) gives you out-of-the-box predictors, handles framework native batch conversions, and gives you an option to resume from AIR Checkpoint.\n",
    "* Ray Datasets handle distributed processing, creating batches of data, pipelining, autoscaling, and memory management.\n",
    "* Ray AIR libraries are connected, giving you an option to scale other parts of your pipeline in the future.\n",
    "\n",

    "When working with [Ray Core]((https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html)) and [Ray AIR](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/getting-started.html), you will notice that they have different focuses. Ray Core enables developers to build and scale distributed Python applications and provides a high level of control, as you write Python code and scale it using Ray primitives. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Ray AIR is a toolkit for simplifying ML compute and abstracts away parallel computing primitives, making it easier to use but with a lower level of control.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, the final recommendation **depends heavily on your specific use case**. Ray Core-based solutions perform well in situations where the batch inference pipeline contains stages that are well-suited for straightforward parallelization. These applications can easily be divided into smaller, independent tasks that can be processed concurrently, without requiring significant communication or coordination between the different processing units.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most batch inference problems, however, it is advisable to **start by using Ray AIR's BatchPredictor** due to its lower barrier to entry, built-in optimizations, ability to abstract away the more tedious aspects of distribution, among many reasons discussed previously.\n",
