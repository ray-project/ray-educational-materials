    "\n",
    "Loading complex models into memory can be expensive and sequential processing of requests limits speed. *Stateless inference* allows an ML system to handle high volume requests by:\n",

    "2. restoring the architecture and weights of a trained model in a stateless function (i.e. Ray tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ray task is *stateless* because its output (e.g. predictions) is determined purely by its inputs (e.g. the trained model). Performing online inference involves loading the model for every request and synchronously serving results.\n",

    "When your deployed model takes too long to generate immediate results, online prediction may not be the right approach. In addition, some situations require predictions to be generated over large volumes of data such as curating personalized playlists. You can use *batch inference*, which is an asynchronous method of batching observations for prediction in advance to process a high volume of samples efficiently.\n",

    "Setting up distributed batch inference with Ray involves:\n",
