    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective debugging and optimizing is crucial in any system, but it becomes even more vital in [distributed settings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing). With a high number of inter-connected, heterogeneous components, updates can cause opaque failures, making it difficult to identify and fix issues. The goal of observability is to allow for the monitoring and understanding of the internal state of the system in real-time to ensure its stability and performance.\n",

    "  <strong>Observability:</a></strong> the ability to understand the behavior of the internal state of a system inferred from its external outputs.\n",

    "Within the context of Ray, [observability](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/index.html) refers to the extent of visibility into distributed applications along with the available tools for inspecting and aggregating performance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is observability challenging in distributed systems?\n",
    "To illustrate the significance of being able to access outputted information through user-friendly tools, consider the [architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBw9A4j62ruI5omIJbMxly-la5w4q_TjyJgJL_jN2fI/preview) of a typical Ray application in the following example code snippet:\n",

    "|Simplified Ray application used for multi-model training on many data batches. The key takeaway is to highlight the scale of coordinating individual machines in a large distributed system, with each introducing an opportunity for failure.|\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Ray cluster](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html) consists of a head node that manages a large number of worker nodes which execute the code of an application. As the scale of the cluster increases, so does the number of [tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html#ray-remote-functions), [actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html#actor-guide), and [objects](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/objects.html#objects-in-ray) that are concurrently executed and [stored across heterogeneous machines](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/memory-management.html#memory).\n",

    "|Actor failure in a Ray cluster with millions of concurrent tasks among [thousands of worker nodes](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/release/benchmarks/README.md).|\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging issues in this environment can be challenging. Among [thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of actors](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/release/benchmarks/README.md), performance bottlenecks, failures, and unpredictable behavior are inevitable. For example, diagnosing a cluster with thousands of actors and millions of processes could contain any number of non-trivial pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How do I know if an actor has failed, especially if the actor failed to initialize in the first place?\n",
    "    -   Some processes may become stuck indefinitely due to incomplete scheduling, known as \"hang.\"\n",
    "-   When I become aware of actor failure(s), how do I know which one(s) caused the issue?\n",
    "    -   In a set-up of tens of thousands of actors, how do I begin to identify the culprit?\n",
    "-   Once I know which actor(s) to inspect, how can I find the log and fix the bug?\n",
    "    -   Filtering through logs and tracing failures is impossible without robust tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Ray runtime](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/starting-ray.html#what-is-the-ray-runtime) manages much of the low-level system behavior in a Ray application which poses a unique opportunity to offer built-in performance data. By providing the right tools to successfully debug, optimize, and monitor Ray applications, developers can troubleshoot issues to improve a system's overall reliability and efficiency."
