    "Effective debugging and optimizing is crucial in any system, but it becomes even more vital in [distributed settings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing). With a high number of inter-connected, heterogeneous components, updates can cause opaque failures, making it difficult to identify and fix issues. The goal of observability is to allow for the monitoring and understanding of the internal state of the system in real-time to ensure its stability and performance.\n",

    "To illustrate the significance of being able to access outputted information through user-friendly tools, consider the [architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBw9A4j62ruI5omIJbMxly-la5w4q_TjyJgJL_jN2fI/preview) of a typical Ray application in the following example code snippet:\n",

    "A [Ray cluster](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html) consists of a head node that manages a large number of worker nodes which execute the code of an application. As the scale of the cluster increases, so does the number of [tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html#ray-remote-functions), [actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html#actor-guide), and [objects](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/objects.html#objects-in-ray) that are concurrently executed and [stored across heterogeneous machines](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/memory-management.html#memory).\n",

    "Debugging issues in this environment can be challenging. Among [thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of actors](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/release/benchmarks/README.md), performance bottlenecks, failures, and unpredictable behavior are inevitable. For example, diagnosing a cluster with thousands of actors and millions of processes could contain any number of non-trivial pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How do I know if an actor has failed, especially if the actor failed to initialize in the first place?\n",
    "    -   Some processes may become stuck indefinitely due to incomplete scheduling, known as \"hang.\"\n",
    "-   When I become aware of actor failure(s), how do I know which one(s) caused the issue?\n",
    "    -   In a set-up of tens of thousands of actors, how do I begin to identify the culprit?\n",
    "-   Once I know which actor(s) to inspect, how can I find the log and fix the bug?\n",
    "    -   Filtering through logs and tracing failures is impossible without robust tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Ray runtime](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/starting-ray.html#what-is-the-ray-runtime) manages much of the low-level system behavior in a Ray application which poses a unique opportunity to offer built-in performance data.

    "The previous two sections discussed the significance of visibility into distributed systems and introduced the State API and Dashboard UI with a simple Ray application. Having laid the groundwork, you can now walk through some common observability stories organized by typical developer workflows: debugging failures and optimizing performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context of Ray, debugging an application refers to failures that emerge during remote processes. This involves the interplay of two main APIs (which have an error handling model [very similar](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors/async_api.html#objectrefs-as-concurrent-futures-futures) to standard Python future APIs):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`.remote`** - Creates a task or actor and starts a remote process; will return an exception if the remote process fails.\n",
    "-   **`.get`** - Retrieves the result from an object reference; raises an exception if the remote process failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [exceptions APIs](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-core/package-ref.html#exceptions) can be grouped into a framework of three primary failure modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Application failures** - \n",
    "This happens when a remote task or actor fails resulting from errors in user-generatedÂ code. Exceptions thrown include `RayTaskError` and `RayActorError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Intentional system failures** - \n",
    "These indicate that while Ray has failed, this failure is a deliberate action. Common examples include using cancellation APIs such as `ray.cancel` for tasks or `ray.kill` for actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Unintended system failures** - \n",
    "These arise when a remote process has failed due to unforeseen system failures, such as process crashes or node failures. The following are typical cases:\n",
    "    -  The out of memory killer randomly terminates processes.\n",
    "    -  The machine is being terminated, particularly in the case of spot instances.\n",
    "    -  The system being highly overloaded or stressed leading to failure.\n",
    "    -  Bugs within Ray Core (relatively infrequent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these failures necessitates a specialized approach. In the following section, you will focus on an out of memory (OOM) example, and feel free to refer to the [debugging user guides](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/monitoring-debugging/troubleshoot-failures.html) for further information on the other types of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Out of memory errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of distributed computing, an out of memory (OOM) error occurs when a node in a cluster tries to use more memory than the amount available, leading to a failure of the entire system. Ray applications [use memory](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/memory-management.html#concepts) in two main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **System memory:** Memory used internally by Ray to manage resources and processes.\n",
    "2.  **Application memory:** Memory used by your application including creating objects in the object store with `ray.put` and reading them with `ray.get`; objects will [spill to disk](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/objects/object-spilling.html#id1) if the store fills up.\n",

Ideally, you want a tool that summarizes resource utilization and usage per node and worker without having to specify each one individually.

    "### Optimizing\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context of Ray, optimization refers to the process of improving the speed and efficiency of an application. Distributed systems can be costly to run and maintain due to multiple interconnected components needing to work together consistently and reliably. By optimizing performance, organizations can achieve better results and reduce costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray has two common types of optimization issues: resource constraints and design anti-patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Resource constraints**\n",
    "- **Number of cores:** Ray will not schedule more tasks than the number of CPUs that it automatically detects.\n",
    "- **Physical vs. logical CPUs:** Speedup is proportional to [physical CPUs, not logical](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-physical-logical-cpus-akshay-deshpande).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Design anti-patterns**\n",
    "- **Small tasks:** Ray introduces overhead for managing each task, so if the task takes less than that overhead (around 10 milliseconds), you are likely to see worse performance.\n",
    "- **Variable durations:** Calling `ray.get` on a batch of tasks with varying durations limits performance to the slowest task.\n",
    "- **Multi-threaded libraries:** When all tasks compete for all resources, you experience contention that prevents runtime improvements.\n",
    "- [**And much more**](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/patterns/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each use case comes with its own unique set of challenges to [troubleshoot](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/monitoring-debugging/troubleshoot-performance.html). In the following section, you will walk through a known design anti-pattern and practice using the relevant observability tools to profile the bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Anti-pattern using `ray.get`\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you have a batch of independent tasks that are submitted at the same time. Each task can take a variable amount of time to complete. That is, one task may be completed quickly while another may take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [this anti-pattern](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/patterns/ray-get-submission-order.html), if you were to call `ray.get()` on the entire batch, your performance would be limited by the longest running task.\n",
