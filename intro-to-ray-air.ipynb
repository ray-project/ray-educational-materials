    "Ray AI Runtime (AIR) is a unified set of libraries built on top of Ray for distributed data processing, model training, tuning, model serving, and reinforcement learning, all in Python. AIR provides simple scalable machine learning for individual workloads and end-to-end workflows, bringing together an ecosystem of integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we lay out each library and their unique jobs to be done, let's take a moment to motivate Ray AIR by taking a high-level view of the data science and machine learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a machine learning system is an iterative and often cyclical process that roughly touches on the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Needs: work with stakeholders to identify business requirements and align on which metric to optimize\n",
    "2. Data Collection: source and collect data and labels\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering: turn raw data into usable material\n",
    "4. Model Training: the learning part of machine learning\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation: try to improve upon your baseline model with hyperparameter tuning or more feature engineering or even a more relevant set of data\n",
    "6. Deployment: deploy your solution to production and/or serve your model to the end user\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the five main native libraries that Ray AIR wraps tackles a specific piece of the ML specific tasks outlined above, and because this abstraction layer is built on top of Ray Core, it is distributed by nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ray Data: load and manipulate data\n",
    "2. Ray Train: scales model training for popular ML frameworks\n",
    "3. Ray Tune: scales experiment execution and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "4. Ray Serve: scales model serving\n",
    "5. Ray RLlib: for distributed reinforment learning workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's contextualize Ray Data, Train, Rune, and Serve with a common ML pipeline for image classification and discuss how each library intersects with the distinct steps we need to distribute this end-to-end example. Towards the end, we will examine a reinforment learning specific workload for RLlib."

    "***\n",
    "Ray Datasets are the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray libraries and applications. They provide basic distributed data transformations such as map, filter, and repartition, and are compatible with a variety of file formats, data sources, and distributed frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets**: Ray Datasets are the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray AIR. In AIR, Datasets are used extensively for data loading, preprocessing, and batch inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessors**: Preprocessors are primitives that can be used to transform input data into features. Preprocessors operate on Datasets, which makes them scalable and compatible with a variety of datasources and dataframe libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Preprocessor is fitted during Training, and applied at runtime in both Training and Serving on data batches in the same way. AIR comess with a collection of built-in prepreocessors, and you can also define your own with simple templates."
